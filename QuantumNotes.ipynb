    "Similar to the probabilistic setting, when a system in a quantum state is measured, the hypothetical observer performing the measurement won't see a quantum state vector, but rather will see some classical state. In this sense, measurements act as an interface between quantum and classical information, through which classical information is extracted from quantum states.\n",

This is known as the Born rule in quantum mechanics. Notice that this rule is consistent with the requirement that the absolute values squared of the entries in a quantum state vector sum to \n",

    "Thus far, it may not be evident why quantum information is fundamentally different from classical information. That is, when a quantum state is measured, the probability to obtain each classical state is given by the absolute value squared of the corresponding vector entry — so why not simply record these probabilities in a probability vector?\n",

    "The answer, at least in part, is that the set of allowable operations that can be performed on a quantum state is different than it is for classical information. Similar to the probabilistic setting, operations on quantum states are linear mappings — but rather than being represented by stochastic matrices, like in the classical case, operations on quantum state vectors are represented by unitary matrices."
